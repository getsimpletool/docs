SimpleTool Server organizes its REST API endpoints into logical groups for easier navigation and management. The endpoints are structured according to their functionality:

- **User**: Authentication and user profile management
- **MCP-SSE**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication with MCP servers
- **Admin**: Server management, user administration, and configuration
- **Tools**: Dynamically generated endpoints based on connected MCP servers
- **Core (Hidden)**: Basic server information and health monitoring

Each group follows RESTful principles with consistent response formats and status codes.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a client to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. Unlike WebSockets, SSE is a one-way communication channel from server to client, making it ideal for scenarios where real-time updates need to be pushed to clients.

SimpleTool Server implements SSE base on own FastAPI SSE implementation.

## üìÑ OpenAPI Specification
>>>>>>> 763b45e (	deleted:    .nfs000000000528209100000005)

SimpleTool Server provides comprehensive OpenAPI documentation for all its endpoints. The server generates two separate OpenAPI specifications:

1. **Complete API Documentation**: Available at `/openapi.json`, this includes all server endpoints including core, admin, and user routes.

2. **Tools-Only Documentation**: Available at `/tools/openapi.json`, this focused specification only includes dynamically generated tool endpoints, making it easier to integrate with tool-specific clients.

API Documentation can be visualized and interacted with through:
- Interactive UI: `/docs` (Swagger)
- Alternative Docs: `/redoc`

The OpenAPI specification is automatically updated when new tools or endpoints are added to the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Endpoint Generation
>>>>>>> 763b45e (	deleted:    .nfs000000000528209100000005)

SimpleTool Server dynamically generates REST endpoints based on connected MCP servers. When a new MCP server is added to the configuration, the system automatically:

1. Discovers available tools from the MCP server
2. Creates corresponding REST endpoints for each tool under `/tools/{mcp-server-name}/{tool-name}`
3. Generates OpenAPI documentation for these endpoints

**Important**: Due to how Swagger UI caches OpenAPI specifications, you may need to refresh your browser after adding new MCP servers to see the newly generated endpoints in the documentation.

=======
## üîí Admin API Security
>>>>>>> 763b45e (	deleted:    .nfs000000000528209100000005)

The Admin API provides centralized management capabilities for the SimpleTool Server. This section contains endpoints for:

- **Server Management**: Configure and monitor the main server
- **User Administration**: Create, update, and delete user accounts
- **MCP Server Management**: Add, remove, and restart MCP servers

All Admin API endpoints require administrator privileges and are protected by JWT authentication. Administrative operations are logged for audit purposes.

## üîí User API Endpoints
>>>>>>> 763b45e (	deleted:    .nfs000000000528209100000005)

User API provides user management capabilities for the SimpleTool Server. This section contains endpoints for:

- **ENV**: Manage own private user environment variables
- **Password**: Change own password
- **API-Keys**: Manage own API keys which are used togethere with MCP/SSE Connection to run `private` mcpServer with `privet` env user settings
- **Server**: Manage own private mcpServer
- **Prompts**: Manage own private prompts
