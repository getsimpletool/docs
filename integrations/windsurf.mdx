## 🔌 Configuration

To connect Windsurf with SimpleTool Server, you need to configure the MCP connection in Windsurf's configuration file.

### 📁 Step 1: Locate the MCP Configuration File

The MCP configuration file is typically located at:

```
~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure the SSE Connection

Add the SimpleTool Server as an MCP server in your configuration file. You'll need to specify:

1. A server name
2. The server URL (pointing to your SimpleTool Server's MCP SSE endpoint)
3. The transport type (SSE)

Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simpletool-sse-server": {
      "serverUrl": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse",
      "transport": "sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `localhost` with the IP address or hostname of your SimpleTool Server.

### ✅ Step 3: Verify the Connection

After configuring the MCP connection, hit `Refresh` in your Windsurf application to apply the changes. You should now be able to access SimpleTool's MCP Tools through Windsurf.

## 🧰 Available Tools

Once connected, Windsurf will have access to all the tools enabled in your SimpleTool Server. These may include:

- 🌐 Web browsing capabilities
- 🔄 HTTP request tools
- ⏰ Time conversion utilities
- 📚 Documentation search
- 🔍 And more, depending on your SimpleTool Server configuration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the integration:

1. 🔄 Verify that your SimpleTool Server is running and accessible
2. 🔗 Check that the server URL in your MCP configuration is correct
3. 🚢 Ensure the transport type is set to "sse"
4. 🧱 Check if any firewalls are blocking the connection

For advanced configuration options, refer to the [⚙️ Environment Variables](/essentials/env) documentation.
